# ENV603-DataViz
Practice and tutorial for ENV603 S21

There are three .R files in this repo, following examples from Healy's Data Viz book: https://socviz.co/index.html#preface.
The goal is to practice working with GitHub, RProjects, and Tidyverse.

You should fork or clone this repository and work through each .R file in order. 
After you complete each exercise, be sure to commit and push your changes. Before starting the next exercise, be sure to pull any changes.
As you work through each exercise, comment your script and perform the suggested edits to each plot. 
The final product for each script is a figure.

Once you finished, you will upload the link to your repo on Canvas.
